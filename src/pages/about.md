Hi! I'm a roboticist living in San Francisco. 
I lead the autonomous technology group at [Skydio](https://www.skydio.com/), where we build advanced autonomous drones based on computer vision. I was born in Armenia and grew up in Alaska before studying at Princeton and then moving west to get my Masterâ€™s in robotics from Stanford.

My work focuses on robust approaches to computer vision, deep learning, nonlinear optimization, motion planning, and dynamics. I also have a keen interest in systems architecture and symbolic computation.

In my free time I enjoy making music with guitars and drums, traveling, playing [bughouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bughouse_chess), and flying things.

You can reach me via <a href="mailto:hayk.mart@gmail.com">email</a>.
