Hi! I'm a roboticist living in San Francisco. I lead the autonomy group at [Skydio](https://www.skydio.com/), where we build the best drones in the world for consumers and industry. Our team holds the state of the art in robust visual localization, obstacle avoidance, and motion planning to create trustworthy and intelligent machines that delight, lower costs, and save lives in complex and unknown scenarios.

More generally, I have a keen interest in computer vision, deep learning, nonlinear optimization, systems architecture, and symbolic computation. I was born in Armenia and grew up in Alaska before studying at Princeton and Stanford. In my free time I enjoy playing guitars and drums, traveling, soccer, [bughouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bughouse_chess), and flying things.
